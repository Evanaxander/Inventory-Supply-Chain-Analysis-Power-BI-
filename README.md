Introduction
Efficient management of inventory and supply chain operations is crucial for businesses to optimize costs, meet customer demands, and enhance operational performance. This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of inventory and supply chain metrics, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as warehouse utilization rate, days sales of inventory (DSI), and inventory turnover ratio. The dashboard visualizes critical insights to help businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory optimization and supply chain efficiency.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analyzed
1. Warehouse Utilization Rate
The warehouse utilization rate measures the percentage of warehouse space currently occupied by inventory. In this analysis, the utilization rate stands at approximately 35%, indicating that 65% of the warehouse space remains unused. While this suggests available capacity for additional stock, businesses should assess whether underutilization leads to unnecessary holding costs or if expansion is required to meet future demand.

2. Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)
DSI calculates the average number of days it takes to sell the current inventory. The analysis reveals an average of 16 days to sell inventory, with regional variations—North Region shows 14 days, slightly better than the overall average. A lower DSI is preferable, as it indicates faster inventory turnover and reduced holding costs. However, if DSI increases (e.g., to 30 days), it may signal declining demand or overstocking, requiring strategic adjustments in procurement and sales strategies.

3. Inventory Turnover Ratio
This ratio measures how frequently inventory is sold and replaced over a period. A higher ratio suggests strong sales performance, while a lower ratio indicates slow-moving stock. The analysis helps businesses identify which products are in high demand and which may require promotional efforts or discounts to clear excess stock.

Visualization Insights
1. Transportation Cost by Region and Category
A clustered column chart highlights transportation costs across different regions and product categories. Key findings:

The North Region incurs the highest transportation costs for furniture.

The West Region shows elevated costs for electronics, possibly due to longer shipping distances or higher logistics expenses.
Businesses can use this insight to negotiate better freight rates, optimize delivery routes, or reassess supplier locations to reduce costs.

2. Total Units Sold by Year
A line chart tracks sales trends over time, revealing:

A sales peak in 2022, indicating strong demand.

A decline in 2021, possibly due to market fluctuations or supply chain disruptions.
This trend analysis helps businesses forecast demand, adjust inventory levels, and align production schedules accordingly.

3. Average Lead Time by Category
Lead time—the duration from manufacturing to customer delivery—varies by product category:

Clothing has the longest lead time (~16 days).

Electronics and furniture show moderate lead times.
Reducing lead times can enhance customer satisfaction and minimize backorders. Strategies may include improving supplier coordination or adopting just-in-time (JIT) inventory practices.

4. Back Orders by Status
A column chart categorizes back orders (unfulfilled customer demands due to stockouts) by status:

Fulfilled (838 orders) – Indicates successful restocking.

Pending (248 orders) – Requires urgent attention to prevent customer dissatisfaction.

Canceled (114 orders) – Lost sales opportunities, highlighting the need for better inventory forecasting.

5. Inventory Levels by Region and Category
A stacked bar chart displays current stock levels, helping businesses:

Identify overstocked or understocked items.

Allocate inventory efficiently across regions to meet demand without excess holding costs.

Conclusion and Recommendations
This Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights for optimizing inventory and supply chain operations. Key recommendations include:

Improve Warehouse Utilization – Consider consolidating stock or leasing unused space to reduce costs.

Reduce Lead Times – Strengthen supplier relationships and streamline logistics.

Optimize Transportation Costs – Analyze high-cost regions and explore alternative shipping methods.

Enhance Demand Forecasting – Use historical sales data to prevent stockouts and overstocking.

Monitor Back Orders – Prioritize restocking high-demand items to minimize lost sales.
